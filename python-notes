dictionary:
setdefault will set a key value to a given value as defualt if key is not found, else that value is returned
get will return the value of the key else a default value is returned - but the value is not set
defaultdict - sets up a dictionary with default value kind of initializer while setdefault sets up the value of key, while accessing the key or after it.

__name__ is to find the local scope of the main function and executes as stand alone but importing that does not run that codebase outside of the module - script based at command line.

__init__.py is an empty py file in a each of directories under dir1/dir2/mod so that
mod could be imported in a file as import dir1.dir2.mod
